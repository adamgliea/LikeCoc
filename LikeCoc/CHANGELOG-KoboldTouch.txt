Version 6.1.6		17-Feb-2013
	[FIX] Controllers: fix for most recent createModelBlock fix (caused model to be nil if no custom model used, also fixes Example Game)

Version 6.1.5		09-Feb-2013
	[FIX] Physics: fixed situations where KTPhysicsBody was released prematurely, causing crashes (ie during contact callback)
	[FIX] Controllers: assert that KTSceneViewController is not added as subController but only presented via KTGameController
	[FIX] Controllers: createModelBlock did not execute in KTSceneViewController objects.

Version 6.1.4		01-Feb-2013
	[NEW] Tilemap View Controller has tilemap property for easier access to KTTilemap
	[NEW] Tilemap: tilesetForName:(NSString*)name to get a tileset from KTTilemp by its name
	[NEW] Tilemap: replaceTileset:withTileset: method on KTTilemap to render tiles from a different tileset (change atmosphere, ie summer -> winter)
	[FIX] Tilemap: some tiles incorrectly flipped
	[FIX] Tilemap: tile sprites use lower left corner as origin as in Tiled
	[FIX] Tilemap: added missing headers to KoboldTouch.h
	[FIX] Tilemap: changing visible property of KTTilemapLayer will also change its view's visible property
	[FIX] Controller by name/class/tag now correctly returns controller even during step method

Version 6.1.3		29-Jan-2013
	[NEW] Tilemap: supports multiple tilesets per tile layer
	[NEW] Tilemap: Tilesets have properties
	[NEW] Tilemap: get object/layer by name
	[FIX] Compatibility with Xcode 4.6 (fixed compile errors)

Version 6.1.2		23-Jan-2013
	[API] KTObjectLayerSpawnProtocol: simplified to willCreate & didCreate message for all objects
	[API] KTTilemap: static initializer tilemapWithTMXFile: replaces alloc/init followed by parseTMXFile:
	[API] KTTilemapLayer: tileAt* methods renamed to tileGidAt*
	[NEW] KTTilemapProperties wrapper around NSMutableDictionary for all sorts of tilemap properties
	[NEW] Tilemap: bounding box for polygon/polyline is calculated, and drawn if enabled
	[NEW] Tilemap: get layers and objects by name
	[FIX] Tilemap: sprite batch node initialized with correct capacity, prevents "increase capacity" spamming the log
	[FIX] Tilemap: added missing tileset properties
	[FIX] Tilemap: typedef uint32_t as gid_t, all gids now use gid_t as their datatype (prevents mistakes, emphasize special meaning)
	[FIX] Tilemap: Improved TMX loading time, cleaned up TMX parser code
	[FIX] Tilemap: Support for & drawing of zero-sized Rectangle objects

Version 6.1.1		20-Jan-2013
	[NEW] KTDebugController: can get and log instance size of a Class
	[FIX] Tilemap: object layer position may have incorrect position after scrolling (offset from tile layer)
	[FIX] Tilemap: Refactored tilemap layer models and views

Version 6.1.0		20-Jan-2013
	[NEW] KTTilemapViewController: improved tilemap renderer (orthogonal tilemaps). 
		Loads fast, supports very large tilemaps (millions of tiles) and renders them at 60 fps regardless of size, free of artifacts.
		All TMX features supported: Opacity, Properties, Tile flipping, Objects, etc.
	[NEW] Tilemap: TMX will upscale TMX content automatically on Retina devices. 
		You do not need to create upscaled TMX file versions (-hd/-ipad/-ipadhd)! Simply provide higher resolution tileset images.
	[NEW] Tilemap: Supports PVR tileset images. Will load .pvr.ccz/.pvr.gz/.pvr versions of tileset image automatically (if existing).
		Otherwise will default to loading the tileset image used by Tiled as specified in the TMX.
	[NEW] Tilemap: flexible scrolling API. Scroll to or by position / tile coordinate with either speed or duration, or instantly.
	[NEW] Tilemap: scrolling respects tilemap borders. You can not scroll outside the tilemap borders when using the scrolling API.
	[NEW] Tilemap: object spawn protocol for delegates to interact/modify each object created on an object layer.
	[NEW] Tilemap: can draw objects on object layer as drawing primitives.
	[NEW] KTAction: Run & stop actions for KTEntityModel. Similar to cocos2d actions but completely rewritten.
	[NEW] KTMoveAction: combines functionality of CCMoveTo and CCMoveBy, can also use speed instead of duration.
	[NEW] KTMultiTouchController: can emulate touch events on OS X to turn mouse into touch input device (click = touch, click & drag = move).
	[NEW] KTDrawingPrimitivesViewController: wrapper for CCDrawNode. Can add & remove individual drawing primitives.
	[FIX] Some Xcode docsets incorrectly named, the other docsets were not installed/updated
	[FIX] Add/Remove of subcontrollers in a step method caused a crash (array modified during enumeration)
	[FIX] LOG_EXPR now prints out char/unsigned char values

Version 6.0.5		09-Jan-2013
	[NEW] This change log! W00t!
	[NEW] KTAutoscaleController: scales position of nodes depending on winSize and orientation
	[NEW] Autoscale Example Template: demo project for KTAutoscaleController
	[UPD] cocos2d-iphone v2.1 beta 4 (see ccDeprecated.h/.m for replacements of deprecated methods)
	[FIX] several orientation issues
	[FIX] Lua.h not found on case-sensitive filesystem partitions
	[FIX] kkprep issue causing download page not to display the latest KT version
